<p class="link"><a href="vector/vectorDrawTable v1.html">Plotting vectors - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Vectors:</b>
    This Sim allows you to plot 2 to 6 vectors, and to see the resultant when they are all added.
  <br>The Sim can show the vectors joined top-to-tail or with a single origin,
  <br>The Sim generates random vectors and each vector can be changed by the user.
  <br>The numerical value of each vector is given so you can practise vector addition (choose 'show resultant' to check your answer)</p>

<p class="link"><a href="moments1/moments v1.html">Moments on a beam - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Moments:</b>
    This Sim presents a beam (of variable length) and the vertical forces on the beam.
  <br>The forces can be have their magnitude and distance changed by the user.
<br>The Sim can generate different types of random forces: 1)fully random; 2)total force = 0; 3)total moments = 0; or 4)full equilibrium.
<br>The numerical value of each force is given so it can be used to practise moments calculation.
<br>Before moving forces it is better to move pivot to 0cm.</p>

<p class="link"><a href="moments1/moments v2.html">Moments on a beam - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Moments:</b>
    As above...
  <br>The forces have their magnitude and distance changed SEPERATELY by the user.
<br>A bit slower to make changes...
<br>...but easier to be accurate</p>

<p class="link"><a href="stop/index.html">Various Thinking Distance simulations - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Thinking distance:</b>
  When the simulation starts the car is already moving. You click on the animation to apply the brakes.
  Your reaction time is measured. Different simulations are given that required greater levels of attention.</p>

<p class="link"><a href="mv/index.html">Momentum - 2 body interactions in 1D - click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>Momentum:</b>
  A set of Sims that show either 2 body 'collisions' or 2 body 'explosions'.
  The bodies have variable mass and velocity, and the Sims
  calculate the final velocities and energies after the interactions.
<br>The elasticity of the collisions can be changed from 100% down to 0%.
<br>The energy of the explosions can be altered.</p>


<p class="link"><a href="SHM/SHM resonate v2.html">Simple Harmonic Motion - Resonance- click here</a>
<p class="notes"><b>SHM:</b>
  A Simulation of Driving oscillators, Forced frequencies and Resonance
<br>Readings can be taken from the simulation to draw a <i><b>frequence vs. amplitude</b></i> curve.
