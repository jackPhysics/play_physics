<h1 class="black">What is happening in your head/mind/brain when you add numbers?</h1>

<h3 class="magenta">We can all describe it to a certain extent, any maybe that's what went on it Wundt's laboratory. But those descritions are essentially
  subjective and not behaviourist - can we examine the 'behaviour'?
<br> Yes, how long does it take to add 2 numbers and how does that time compare to adding 3 or 4 or 11?
<br> Is it the same time taken for how ever many digits? Or does the number of digits matter?
<br> Is there a pattern? Even a correlation?
<br> And once we have examined our results what can we now 'infer' about the 'mind'?</h3>

<p>INSTRUCTIONS:
<br>Choose from 5 to 30 rounds - each round is a set of random digits between 1 and 9 
<br>- the number of digits is randomly chosen to be between 2 and 7 digits.
<br>Below the digits are buttons labelled 0 thru' 9 and 00 thru' 90.
<br> click the correct buttons to give your answer...
<br> example: if your answer is 24 - click button 20 and button 4
<br> if your answer is 40 - click button 40 and button 0
<br>if your answer is 7 - click button 00 and button 7
<br>- YOU MUST ALWAYS CLICK 2 BUTTONS.
<br>Do so as quickly as you can.
<br>If your answer is correct you move on to the next round, otherwise it waits for you to click the correct answer.
<br>After the number of rounds is completed the results are displayed:
  <br>For each round - the number of digits and the time taken
  <br>The average time taken for each nuber of digits (is there a pattern/correlation?)
  <br>Timings are given in milliseconds, divide by 1000 to convert to seconds
</p>

<p>After you have done the above investigation sufficiently enough to find some pattern, can you predict what the timings should be for 8 to 11 digits?
<br>Write down your predictions, and then use the following program to actually measure the timings:</p>

  </p>

<p>How good were your predictions? Is there a statistical test to measure the strength of your predictions?</p>
