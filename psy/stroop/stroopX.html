<h1 class="orange">The Stroop test:</h1>

<h2>There are 2 extra versions available here - one where the buttons are coloured but unlabelled 
  and another which measures the 'velocity' of the mouse movement</h2>

<h3>Colored buttons that lack text - so just colour-matching, not reading</h3>

<p><a href="stroopTest_phase1_vSPECnoname.html" target="_blank">Test 1: Baseline test with unlabelled but coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>do the baseline test first, to get a baseline time for how long it takes you to click the buttons.
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30).
<br>the word displayed will be the same colour as itself eg "RED" will be red.
<br>click the button that is the same colour as the word displayed.
</p>
    
<p><a href="stroopTest_phase2_vSPECnoname.html" target="_blank">Test 2: True Stroop test with unlabelled but coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30)
<br>the word displayed will be a different colour to itself eg "RED" will be coloured blue, or green, or yellow, but never red.
<br>click the button that is the same COLOUR as the COLOUR of the word displayed, NOT to the colour of the WORD displayed.
<br>compare your new time to the baseline time you got in test 1 - did it take you longer?
<br>
<br>In this version no 'reading' is required, just colour matching, so does that make it easier with less chance of mental 'conflict'?
</p>

<h3>7 coloured buttons - with 'velocity' being measured to balance out buttons that are further from each other adding to the total time to click the buttons</h3>
    
<p><a href="stroopTest_phase1 vVEL.html" target="_blank">Test 1: Baseline test with 7 coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>do the baseline test first, to get a baseline time for how long it takes you to click the buttons, 
  and a baseline 'velocity' (velocity = pixels moved / time taken) 
  so you are not penalised for having to move from 'violet' across to 'red', compared to moving say from 'green' to 'cyan' or other adjacent colours.
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30).
<br>the word displayed will be the same colour as itself eg "RED" will be red.
<br>click the button that corresponds to the colour and the word displayed.
</p>

<p><a href="stroopTest_phase2 vVEL.html" target="_blank">Test 2: True Stroop test with 7 coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30)
<br>the word displayed will be a different colour to itself eg "RED" will be coloured any of 6 other colours, but never red.
<br>click the button that corresponds to the COLOUR of the word displayed, NOT to the word displayed.
<br>compare your new time to the baseline time you got in test 1 - did it take you longer?
