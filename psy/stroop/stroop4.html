<h1 class="orange">The Stroop test:</h1>

<h2>There are 2 versions available here - one where the buttons are coloured and the second where the buttons are not coloured - does it make a difference?</h2>

<h3>Colored buttons</h3>

<p><a href="stroopTest_phase1.html" target="_blank">Test 1: Baseline test with coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>do the baseline test first, to get a baseline time for how long it takes you to click the buttons.
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30).
<br>the word displayed will be the same colour as itself eg "RED" will be red.
<br>click the button that corresponds to the colour and the word displayed.
</p>

<p><a href="stroopTest_phase2.html" target="_blank">Test 2: True Stroop test with non-coloured buttons</a> <br>
<br>choose how many words to be displayed one at a time (from 5 to 30)
<br>the word displayed will be a different colour to itself eg "RED" will be coloured blue, or green, or yellow, but never red.
<br>click the button that corresponds to the COLOUR of the word displayed, NOT to the word displayed.
<br>compare your new time to the baseline time you got in test 1 - did it take you longer?
</p>
