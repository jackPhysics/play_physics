    <h3 style="color:cyan">NUCLEAR WINDOW:</h3>
<p>The following programs are based on the same program - <b><i>Nuclear Window</i></b> - 
  which enables you to see an individual nucleus, fire particles at it and watch it decay if unstable<br>
It has a database of all stable nuclei so it always gets stability correct and it uses an algorithm to 
  determine decay mode for unstable nuclei that is pretty close to reality - U238 decay sequence is spot on - but Fission is not programmed in...</p>

    <p> You start off with a Hydrogen nucleus but you input what values of protons and neutrons you want to start with,
  or you can set the program to continously fire in the same particle (eg protons, to simulate the situation at the heart of a star..., or alphas etc) 
  and leave it running - will it make everything?</p>

<p class="notes"><p>The Physics in this one is a bit dodgy...<br>
Basically it is a space into which you can drag Protons (red) and Neutrons (blue) and try to put them together to make stable nuclei...<br>
The nuclei inside the space can be rotated around so as to view it from different angles...<br>
Unfortunately (to rather annoying sound effects) the nucleons will keep jiggling about and keep decaying into the other type of nucleon...<br>
You can alter how the nucleons 'jiggle', whether they fall towards a common centre, what is the effective range of the nuclear and EM forces, the chances of decay if a nucleon finds itself in an 'unstable' position, etc...(warning: the "EM turn-off" button is a dummy button, it does nothing - could this program be any more annoying!?)<br>
You can retrieve information about how many other nucleons each nucleon is touching - is this the secret of nuclear stability?.<br>
Does any of it lead you to any deeper understanding as to why some nuclei are stable while others are unstable? Probably not.<br>
One other interesting thing to do is to press the big red STOP button to stop all movement and then use the program as a means of investigating the packing of spheres</p>
<p>To further help your investigations here is a spreadsheet that lists all the stable nuclei <a href="balldrag/chart of N.xls" target=_blank>spreadsheet</a><br>
 I have managed to put together 3 p and 3 n and they are stable, as they should be. Now the table says 3p and 4n are stable, what happens when I add another n? Where should I add it?...<br>
Yey! I done it! A row of 3 p's with a ring of 4 n's around the middle... - stable! Here's the screen dump if you don't believe me: <a href="nck/Li7.html" target=_blank>Lithium-7</a>!</p>
