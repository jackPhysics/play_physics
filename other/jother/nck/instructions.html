<h3>Basic instructions for using the eMac Nucleus Constructor Kit</h3> 

<H2>MOVING NUCLEONS</H2>
<P>Drag the nucleons from where they are stored in the black box into the boxed viewing area.</p>
<p>To select a nucleon click on any part of it.</p>
<p>Drag the nucleon with the mouse to change its 'x' or 'y' position.</p>
<p>To change a nucleon's 'z' position you use the keyboard:<br>
<B>Z</B> pushes the last selected nucleon further down into the page.<br>
<B>Q</B> pulls the last selected nucleon up out of the page.<br>
Each nucleon displays its 'z' coordinate, so you can 'see' where exactly they are. The displayed number refers to the centre spot of the nucleon. The nucleons have a radius of 25 units so their edges are 25 units greater or lesser than the displayed values.</p>
<p>Nucleons can 'feel' each other and cannot occupy the same space so their movement left/right, up/down, in/out will be impeded if there is another nucleon in the way</p>

<H2>FOCUS</H2>
<p>The last selected nucleon has the FOCUS on it.<br>
It's x and y position are displayed at the top, and the number of other nucleons that it is touching. When you use the Z, Q, F  keys these all act on the nucleon that has the focus.<br>
You can change the focus to a new nucleon by just clicking on it.<br>
Pressing <B>S</B> highlights (Shows) which nucleon currently has the focus (pressing <B>S</B> again turns off the highlight).
Pressing <B>J</B> Jumps the focus to the next nucleon in sequence (useful if the nucleon you want it buried under lots of others and you cannot get to it with the mouse).</p>

<H2>ROTATING THE VIEW POINT</H2> 
The cursor keys will rotate whatever is inside the viewing box (around the 2 axes shown - these axes are at z=250)).<br>
The 'left' cursor rotates the nucleus around to the left etc.</p>
<p>(if your cursor keys don't work - which might happen in Netscape then...<br>
use <B>N</B> and <B>M</B> to rotate left/right<br>
and <B>O</B> and <B>L</B> to rotate up/down)</P>
